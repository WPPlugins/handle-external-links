== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to set a "best before date" for my posts? =

In your admin panel, click on the 'Settings' menu tab and navigate to 'Handle External Links'. Here you can pick a date that will affect all posts/pages older than this value.

= How does "Set Nofollow on 404's" work? =

This feature will automatically ping the URLs to check whether the page returns a 404 status or not. If there's a 404 it will set the link to rel="nofollow".

= How do I set nofollow based on PageRank? =

Navigate to the Settings page and select a PageRank from the dropdown. Note: If you select PR 9 it will result in setting nofollow on all your external links because it's practically impossible to have a greater PR.
